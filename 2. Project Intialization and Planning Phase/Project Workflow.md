## Data Preprocessing

- Clean and tokenize text data, remove stopwords, and apply stemming.
- Convert text into numerical features using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF.
## Model Development

Train sentiment classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or BERT.
## Model Optimization

- Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluate model performance with cross-validation.
## Deployment
- Develop a web application using Flask or FastAPI for real-time sentiment analysis.
