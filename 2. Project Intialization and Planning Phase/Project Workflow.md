# Project Workflow
The project will follow these phases:

## 1. Data Collection and Exploration

- Gather customer reviews from Amazon.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand review patterns.
## 2. Data Preprocessing

- Clean and tokenize text data, remove stopwords, and apply stemming.
- Convert text into numerical features using CountVectorizer or TF-IDF.
## 3. Model Development

Train sentiment classification models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or BERT.
## 4. Model Optimization

- Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- Evaluate model performance with cross-validation.
## 5. Deployment
- Develop a web application using Flask or FastAPI for real-time sentiment analysis.
