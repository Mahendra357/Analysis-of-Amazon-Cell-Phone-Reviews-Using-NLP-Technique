Assignment No - 4:
Creating a Flask CRUD Application with SQLite
Develop a Flask web application that allows users to manage a list of tasks using a SQLite database. The application should implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for tasks.
1. Database Setup
* Create a SQLite Database:
Use the sqlite3 module to create a new SQLite database file. Ensure the database is initialized when the application starts.
* Create a Table:
Define a table named tasks with the following columns:
   * id: Primary key (integer).
   * description: Task description (text).
   * status: Task completion status (integer, 0 for incomplete, 1 for complete).
2. Flask Application Setup
   * Set Up the Flask Application:
Create a new Python file and import necessary modules like Flask, sqlite3, request, render_template, and redirect.
3. Define Routes
      * Home Page:
Create a route that will display a list of all tasks retrieved from the database.
      * Create Task:
Define a route that allows users to add new tasks by handling form submission.
      * Update Task:
Define a route that enables users to modify existing tasks.
      * Delete Task:
Define a route that provides a way for users to delete tasks.
4. CRUD Operations
         * Create:
Handle form submission to create new tasks, and insert the task data into the SQLite database. Redirect the user to the home page upon successful task creation.
         * Read:
Retrieve all tasks from the database and display them on the home page.
         * Update:
Allow users to edit existing tasks via a form, update the task description and completion status in the database, and redirect to the home page.
         * Delete:
Provide a form to confirm deletion of a task, remove the task from the database, and redirect to the home page.
5. Templating
            * Create HTML Templates:
Use a template engine like Jinja2 to create the following templates:
               * home.html: List all tasks.
               * create.html: Form to create a new task.
               * update.html: Form to update an existing task.
               * Optional: Add a delete.html page to confirm deletion.
